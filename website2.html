            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>After high school I plan to attend Fresno State as I will be majoring in computer science. My high school computer science teacher, Mr. Maresh has really helped me strive for my passion of computer science. As for volleyball I will not be playing for college but will be involved in the Hmong volleyball community around the world.</p>
